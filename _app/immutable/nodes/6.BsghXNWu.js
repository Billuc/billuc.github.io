            A university project we did as a team of 6. Tri Select'IF is a mobile game whose intent

	        A simple game where you control a bouncing ball and have to catch all the stars.
	        I made it with Java during holidays. It was heavily inspired by a game we used

	        I was interested in the way computers could show 3D objects on a 2D screen.
	        So I tried to develop a simple 3D engine that could display dots at certain
	        coordinates. The camera can move so we can see the dots get closer or further.
